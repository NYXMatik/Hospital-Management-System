## 1. Context

As an Admin, I want to list/search operation types, so that I can see the details,
edit, and remove operation types.

## 2. Requirements

- Admins can search and filter operation types by name, specialization, or status
  (active/inactive).
- The system displays operation types in a searchable list with attributes such as name, required
  staff, and estimated duration.
- Admins can select an operation type to view, edit, or deactivate it.

## 3. Analysis

**Deactivation vs Removal**:

- **Question**: Is removing an **operation** **type** the same as deactivating it?
- **Answer**: Yes, deactivating makes the **operation** **type** unavailable for future use but retains historical data.
