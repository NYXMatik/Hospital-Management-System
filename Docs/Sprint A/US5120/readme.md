## 1. Context

As an Admin, I want to add new types of operations, so that I can reflect the
available medical procedures in the system.

## 2. Requirements

- Admins can add new operation types with attributes like:
- Operation Name
- Required Staff by Specialization
- Estimated Duration
- The system validates that the operation name is unique.
- The system logs the creation of new operation types and makes them available for scheduling
  immediately.

## 3. Analysis

â€¢ Attributes:

- `ID` (unique identifier)
- `Name` (e.g., appendectomy, heart bypass)
- `Required Staff by Specialization` (list of essential staff in respect to
  specialization)
- `Estimated Duration` (of the operation type)
