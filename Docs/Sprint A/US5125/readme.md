## 1. Context

- As a Patient, I want to delete my account and all associated data, so that I can
exercise my right to be forgotten as per GDPR.

## 2. Requirements

- Patients can request to delete their account through the profile settings.
- The system sends a confirmation email to the patient before proceeding with account deletion.
- Upon confirmation, all personal data is permanently deleted from the system within the legally
required time frame (e.g., 30 days).
- Patients are notified once the deletion is complete, and the system logs the action for GDPR
compliance.
- Some anonymized data may be retained for legal or research purposes, but all identifiable
information is erased.
