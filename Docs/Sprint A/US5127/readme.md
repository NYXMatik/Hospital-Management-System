## 1. Context

- As a Patient, I want to log in to the healthcare system using my external IAM
credentials, so that I can access my appointments, medical records, and other
features securely.


## 2. Requirements

- Patients log in via an external Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider (e.g., Google,
Facebook, or hospital SSO).
- After successful authentication via the IAM, patients are redirected to the healthcare system
with a valid session.
- Patients have access to their appointment history, medical records, and other features relevant
to their profile.
- Sessions expire after a defined period of inactivity, requiring reauthentication
