## 1. Context

As a (non-authenticated) Backoffice User, I want to log in to the system using my
credentials, so that I can access the backoffice features according to my assigned
role.

## 2. Requirements

- Backoffice users log in using their username and password.
- Role-based access control ensures that users only have access to features appropriate to their
role (e.g., doctors can manage appointments, admins can manage users and settings).
- After five failed login attempts, the user account is temporarily locked, and a notification is
sent to the admin.
- Login sessions expire after a period of inactivity to ensure security.
