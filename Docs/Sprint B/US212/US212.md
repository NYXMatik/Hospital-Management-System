## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 Business Rules
* A staff must be unique in terms of `License Number`, `Email` and `Phone`.
* Staff define the availability slots, e.g. slot 1: 2024-09-25:14h00-18h00; slot2:
  2024-09-25:19h00/2024-09-26:02h00.
* The availability slots remain unchanged when slots are used for an
  appointment.
* Staff can handle multiple appointments but cannot be double-booked at the
  same time.
