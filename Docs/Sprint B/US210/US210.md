# US 6.2.10

## 1. Context

The context of this US to implement the user interface to create a new staff profile, which represents the professional providing healthcare (doctors and nurses), and add that profiles to the hospital’s roster. This user story belongs to the Backoffice Web Application module.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. User Story Description

- **US 6.2.10** As an Admin, I want to create a new staff profile, so that I can add them to the hospital’s roster.

### 2.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

> Question 1 - ID
>
> Q: Are healthcare staff IDs unique across roles?
>
> A: Yes, staff IDs are unique and not role-specific (e.g., a doctor and nurse can share the same ID format).

> Question 2 – ID and License Number
>
> Q: I have one question related to the staff license number.
Since it will be generated, would you like it to be generated in any particular format or algorithm of your choice?
>
> A: There is a misinformation in the RFP.
> **Staff id** are *unique* and *generated by the system.*
> **License numbers** are *unique* but are *not generated by the system*.
>
>  > License numbers are assigned by the professional guild. The admin will enter the license number and the system records it.
>
>  >Staff id follow the format "(N | D | O)yyyynnnnn" for instance, N202401234
> >
>  >N is for nurse, D is for doctor, O is for other.
> >
>  >yyyy is the year of recruitment
> >
>  >nnnnn is a sequential number

> Question 3 - Specialization
>
> Q: Médicos e enfermeiros podem ter apenas uma especialidade ou podem ser especialistas em várias?
Quem faz parte do staff? Toda a gente na sala de operação? Se sim, todos eles tem as suas respetivas especialidades, incluindo técnicos?
>
> A: Um médico ou enfermeiro apenas tem uma especialização. No staff apenas consideramos médicos e enfermeiros.

> Question 4 - Mechanographic number, Staff id and License number
>
> Q: Can you clarify the difference between mechanographic number, staff id and license number?
>
> A: The staff id and mechanographic number is the same concept. The license number is the number assigned by the professional guild (ex., "ordem dos enfermeiros", "ordem dos médicos") to the doctor or nurse attesting they legally can perform the medical acts of their profession.

> Question 5 - Account role vs Staff role
>
> Q: As it you mentioned before " A unique staff ID is generated upon profile creation" and "Staff id follow the format "(N | D | O)yyyynnnnn" for instance, N202401234. N is for nurse, D is for doctor, O is for other. yyyy is the year of recruitment and nnnnn is a sequential number."
>
>My question is how are we suposed to generate an ID that needs the role to be correctly generated upon profile creation if there is no infomation about the role of the staff upon profile creation and firstly the profile is created and only then can be linked to an account wich actually contains information about the role.
>
> A: Going a little bit too technical, it seems you are mixing the "account" and "role" concepts within the "autentication and authorization" subdomain, and the "collaborator/staff" and "role" concepts within the "collaborator/staff subdomain.
> When the admin creates an account they assign it a role for role-based permissions, e.g., someone with role A can access function F1 but not F2
> When the admin creates a staff profile they assign it a role/category to describe the capabilities and responsibilities of that person within the system, e.g., someone with role/category "Doctor" has a specialization "X" and requests an operation of type "O" for a patient "P"

> Question 6 - list of specializations
>
> Q: Will there be a list of specializations in the system?
>
> A: Yes, a predefined list of specializations will be provided, but the system should allow for future additions.

> Question 7 - shared specializations
>
> Q: Regarding the specializations, do doctors, nurses, and technicians share the same group of specializations, or does each type of professional have distinct, role-specific specializations? Could you clarify how these specializations are categorized?
>
> A: They share the same set of specializations.

> Question 8 - User interface
> 
> Q: Gostaríamos de lhe perguntar se tem algum grupo de funções ou aparência que espera para as UIs das USs passadas ou se fica a cargo da equipa que desenvolve os aspetos estéticos da aplicação.
> 
> A: A componente estética é de livre escolha da equipa. tentem seguir as boas práticas de aplicações web e usabilidade.

### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 Business Rules
* A staff must be unique in terms of `License Number`, `Email` and `Phone`.
* Staff define the availability slots, e.g. slot 1: 2024-09-25:14h00-18h00; slot2:
2024-09-25:19h00/2024-09-26:02h00.
* The availability slots remain unchanged when slots are used for an
appointment.
* Staff can handle multiple appointments but cannot be double-booked at the
same time.
